## 👨‍💼 Admin Setup

### First Admin Setup
```bash
# Run this once after deployment
python deployment/setup_admin.py YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID
```

### Admin Commands
```
/add_admin <user_id>                    # Add new admin
/exceptional_hours <user_id> <date> <start> <end> [reason]
/admin_report                           # Daily dashboard
/list_employees                         # Employee directory

## 📱 Employee Experience

### 🔒 Enhanced Security
1. **Location Required**: Employees MUST share location for check-in/out
2. **Range Enforcement**: Must be within 100m of office
3. **No Manual Entry**: GPS coordinates cannot be typed manually

### 📝 Reason Prompts
1. **Late Check-in**: 
   - System detects if arrival is after 09:00 (or exceptional hours)
   - Prompts for reason before allowing check-in
   - Stores reason with timestamp

2. **Early Check-out**:
   - System detects if departure is before 17:00 (or exceptional hours)
   - Prompts for reason before allowing check-out
   - Stores reason with timestamp

### 🎯 User Flow Example
```
Employee: *shares location at 09:30*
Bot: ⏰ Late Check-in Detected
     Your work starts at 09:00, but it's now 09:30.
     📝 Please provide a reason for being late:

Employee: "Traffic jam on the bridge"
Bot: ✅ Late Check-In Recorded
     ⏰ Time: 09:30:00
     📝 Reason: Traffic jam on the bridge
     ✨ Thank you for providing the reason!
```

## 📊 Daily Summary Features

### 8 PM Admin Report
Admins receive comprehensive daily summaries including:

```

```

## 🖥️ Server Wake-Up System

### How It Works
1. **Health Checks**: Every 14 minutes, the system makes HTTP requests to `/health`
2. **Render Compatibility**: Prevents free tier from sleeping after 15 minutes
3. **Activity Logging**: All wake-up attempts are logged in database
4. **Error Handling**: Continues operation even if health checks fail

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check server activity logs
/server_status

# View detailed logs
Admin Dashboard -> View Logs
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Database Enhancements
```sql
-- New columns in attendance table
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN late_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN early_checkout_reason TEXT;
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN is_late BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;
ALTER TABLE attendance ADD COLUMN is_early_checkout BOOLEAN DEFAULT 0;

-- New exceptional_hours table
CREATE TABLE exceptional_hours (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    telegram_id INTEGER,
    date DATE,
    work_start_time TEXT,
    work_end_time TEXT,
    reason TEXT,
    created_by INTEGER
);

-- Server activity tracking
CREATE TABLE server_activity (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    activity_type TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    details TEXT
);
```

### Security Features
- **Location Validation**: Double verification with radius checking
